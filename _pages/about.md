My name is Ali Rahimi Kalahroudi (Written as "_علی رحیمی‌کلهرودی_" in my native language—Persian). I am currently a research M.Sc. student in computer science at Université de Montréal and MILA under the supervision of Prof. Sarath Chandar. I received my B.Sc. in computer science at the Sharif University of Technology.

I am interested in building practical intelligent machines that not only can interact amongst themselves but also with humans. I want to draw inspiration from the human brain's concepts to both construct and evaluate them.

While I am not doing science, I enjoy reading books, watching movies, playing football and volleyball, and hiking.

### Interests

Current research interests:

- (Deep) Reinforcement Learning
- Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
- Continual Learning
